## Task 3: Operating Systems worksheet

Question 1: Describe four roles of the Operating systems in a computer.

Memory management <br>
This idea refers to management of either main memory or primary memory, especially it does keep track of them (Which part of memory is used, and by whom) , and allocate possible memory  when the process requests it to do so.

Processor management <br>
This idea refers to determine which process gets the processor when and how much time, this is called process scheduling.
(Allocate the CPU to a process)

Device management <br>
This idea refers to manage device communication through their respective drivers, especially it does decide which process gets the device and for  how much time, and allocating the device in an efficient way.

File management <br>
This idea commonly refers to organize into directories for easy navigation and usage. OS also does keep track of various information such as status, location, usage, etc… , and determine who gets the resources.


Question 2: What did you find surprising from the video about the Operating systems (#1) Describe below your point:

The video includes a bunch of information that amazed me, but one thing that I would highlight is all kinds of Oses have have multitasking and vertical protected memory so that they can execute many programs at once.
I do understand we use laptops and smartphones on a daily basis, but I did not know why they work pretty well and are competent enough to do lots of things at the same time.

Question 3: Watch the video showing the market share for the most popular Operating Systems during the last years (#2). Describe the trends shown in the graph.

The video illustrates Windows 10 is the most popular Operating System during last year, and it accounts for approximately 59% of the entire market.
Furthermore, the video indicates the tendency of how the OS market changes.
From 2004 to 2009, there were basically 4 types of OS there: Mac OS, WinXP, Linux, and other windows OS. Obviously, Windows XP was the most used operating system(64%), and the rest of the OS were competing with each other.
From 2009 to 2013, however, Windows 7 was exponentially increasing and overtook Windows 10 OS. After Windows 7 has overtaken Windows 10, windows8 has gradually increased until 2015. (At this point, Mac OS and Linux are still about equal, which means there is not that huge gap between them)
Eventually, from 2015 to 2019, the latest version of Windows OS called Windows 10 has taken the place of number one shared Operating System in the whole market.

Question 4: Identify the original creators of Operating Systems in video #2. Add the citations for your sources.

All versions of Windows OS are made by Bill Gates.

Linux is made by Linus Torvalds.

Mac OS is developed by an American computer company called Apple Inc.

Chrome OS is made by Google.
(“Chromium OS.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 24 Aug. 2020, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_OS. )

Question 5: The list below states some of the least known open source operating systems. Research what they are mainly used for, what graphical interface system they use and what are the minimal specifications of the computer needed to run them. 


Red hat <br>
Used for what: This is known as Linux distribution called Red Hat Enterprise Linux, this supports software and technologies for…
automation, cloud, containers, middleware, storage, application development, microservices, virtualization, management, and more.

Graphical interface system it uses: RHEL8

Minimal specifications: 6GB free disk space, 2 GB of RAM

CentoOS <br>
Used for what: This is also Linux distribution, this open-source operating system is used by both institutions and organizations for development and servers of production. (For instance, getting a firewall, building a web server, etc…)

Graphical interface system it uses: We need to install desktop environments such as Gnome or KDE because of Web server OS.

Minimal specifications: 2GB RAM,  2GHz or higher processor, 20GB hard disk, and 64-bit x86 system.


SUSE <br>
Used for what: This OS is designed for servers, mainframes, and workstations.

Graphical interface system it uses: This includes the X.org server, Wayland, and GNOME desktop.

Minimal specifications: 1GB minimum, and 500 MB disk space required.

Linux Mint <br>
Used for what: This OS is based on both Ubuntu and Debian, and this includes various applications such as office app. 

Graphical interface system: It uses Cinnamon as the desktop environment while the other uses MATE.

Minimal specifications: 5 GB of disk space, 512MB RAM

Fedora <br>
Used for what: Linux-based operating system and this is designed as either a secure or general-purpose operating system.

Graphical interface system it uses: This does not have any GUI by default.

Minimal specifications: At least 256 MB of memory, and 7 GB of disk space.


Knoppix <br>
Used for what: It can be used as a Linux demo, educational disc, rescue system, or platform for commercial software development demos.

Graphical interface system it uses:  graphical LXDE-GU

Minimal specifications: 512 MG for graphics mode, but 2 GB is recommended. 

Manjaro <br>
Used for what: user-friendly Linux-based distribution, it provides all benefits of cutting edge software combined with a focus on user-friendliness.

Graphical interface system it uses: It has Xfcam KDE Plasma5, and GNOME by default.

Minimal specifications: 1 GB of memory and 30 GB of hard disk space.

Kali <br>
Used for what: It is basically used for penetration testing and security audition by using a dozen of tools.

Graphical interface system it uses: GNOME desktop environment.

Minimal specifications: 3.6 GB hard disk space, 257MB RAM.



[HL] Task: Pick one of the OS in the list above (or any other you find which is open source), download it, and install it in your computer using a Virtual Machine (Tutorial Here). Prepare 3 Slides with your experience, plus you will show us the operating system running and some interesting software applications included, check the games and office applications. Enjoy!
